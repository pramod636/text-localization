# Text Localization
A simple project detailing the process of text localization in an iOS app. This is a linked project from a medium article explaining it in a bit more detail. The article and hence this project covers :-

1. Localization of strings in code (which needs to be wrapped in the macro

> NSLocalizedString()

2. Localization of strings hard-coded in the interface builder files like **.xib** and **.storyboard**.

This repo contains 3 branches

- **master:** Always having the latest code
- **before-localization:** Project and code as it was before performing text localization on it
- **after-localization:** Project and code after the completion of the localization process. It also contains folders that hold the **.xliff** files as it was exported (pre translation) and from which the import was done. (post translation)
